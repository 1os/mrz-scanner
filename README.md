# Quickstart

## Web
You can build the scripts, start a web server and open a browser, with eg:
```
git clone https://github.com/alsenet-labs/mrz-scanner
cd mrz-scanner
npm start
```
The code is now "same-origin friendly". That means it can be run in the browser from the filesystem (no web server required), with eg:
```
git clone https://github.com/alsenet-labs/mrz-scanner
cd mrz-scanner
npm install
gulp dist
xdg-open dist/index.html
```
## Command line
```
git clone https://github.com/alsenet-labs/mrz-scanner
cd mrz-scanner
npm install .
mrz2json [ -d|--dest-dir <directory> ] <png_or_jpg_or_tiff> [...]
```

or

```
npm install -g mrz-scanner
mrz2json [ -d|--dest-dir <directory> ] <jpg_or_png_or_tiff> [...]
```
On success the result will be stored in a file suffixed by ".mrz.json" along the original image by default.
